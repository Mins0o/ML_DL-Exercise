# ML_DL_Correlation_Convolution-Exercise
Trying to understand the difference between ML and DL and compare Convolution and Cross Correlation.
### Motivation
I recently worked on the [Door Opener](https://github.com/Mins0o/Door_Opener) project with my limited knowledge and wanted to learn how machine learning is done on images. So I took a special one week crash course about computer vision offered from my Univ. and learned about deep learning for the first time. I wanted to explore the field of traditional machine learning and newly trending deep learning and get familiar with it.  
  
For this exercises, I will be doing supervised classifications.
### Name Classification
This is how I first encountered the world of machine learning. I took an NLP course last semester and learned about classifiers for the first time.  
I thought revisiting this example will be perfect as a warmup.
### Audio Classification
This is an extension from my last project, the [Door Opener](https://github.com/Mins0o/Door_Opener). Carrying on from the project, I wanted to experience machine learning development process in more extent: From data acquiring, processing to feature extraction and classifier experiments.
